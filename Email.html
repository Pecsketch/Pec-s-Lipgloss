            <p>Dear Agent <span class="Blur"> Chioma </span></p>
            <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="Blur"> Project Cadmus program</span>has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
            <p>We suspect that <span class="Blur"> General Chioma</span>is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hideen laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it is too late. </p>
            <p> Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeropadise the entire operation.</p>
